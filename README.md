# Personal config files

## installer.sh only works on Arch Linux or other distros using Pacman.

## Zsh
Some of the files are currently under development.

### p10k.zsh
Requires nerdfonts and powerline

### zshrc
Not completed. Contains several useless lines. Going to split this further apart later on.

### zplug.zsh
Still testing plugins. I need to comment on these, and figure out which works and which does not.
Requires zplug to be installed to .zplug/

## Vim
Completely rewritten 28.03.2021.

Vimrc sources files from ~/.vim where settings are semi-modular.

* vimrc settings are found in ~/.vim/vimrc
* Current file templates are located in ~/.vim/templates
Requires plug.
